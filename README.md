Language: Javascript
Library : React 
Build tool: Vite
CSS framework : tailwind (Daisy UI : component library)

React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) used to build user interfaces—especially web apps.
React only for the view layer (UI)
React Does not include routing, state management, or backend login by default, for that u need to install external modules like react-router-dom, redux, etc

What react acutally does: 
    Creates UI Components
    Efficiently update DOM using a virtual DOM
    Manages component States

Whereas, Anguler is framework which includes everything like http client, routing, state handling, forms, CLI, Templates
